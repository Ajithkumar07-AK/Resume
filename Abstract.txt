You want to build an Android app (APK) where a user uploads a resume (as an image or other format), taps a button to analyze it with AI, and receives:

AI recommendations (in a conversational style) on how to improve the resume/cover letter.
The option to apply those recommendations automatically.
A score for the improved resume/letter.
Here’s a high-level breakdown of what you need to implement:

Resume Input:
Allow users to upload a resume as an image (JPG/PNG) or document (PDF/DOCX).
Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images (e.g., with Google ML Kit or Tesseract).
For PDFs/DOCX, use a library to extract text (e.g., Apache PDFBox, Apache POI).
AI Analysis:
Send the extracted text to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Gemini, or a custom model) via API.
The AI should:
Analyze the resume/letter.
Provide conversational feedback (recommendations for improvement).
Optionally, generate a revised version of the letter/resume.
Assign a score based on quality.
UI/UX:
Show recommendations in a chat-like interface.
Provide a button to “Apply Recommendations” and show the improved letter.
Display the score after improvements.
Implementation Steps:
Android app with file/image picker and a button to analyze.
Integrate OCR and document parsing.
Connect to an AI API for analysis and recommendations.
Display results in a conversational UI.
Implement “Apply Recommendations” and scoring logic.
